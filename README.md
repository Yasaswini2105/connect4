# Connect4
Connect 4 is a two-player game  We used python 3 to code the game The game is between you and the ai We should arrange 4 discs of same color in a row either vertically, horizontally or diagonally in order to win the game. Strategy: we have assigned a scoring mechanism according to the moves the players make.

If the players strategy is good, he gets good scores and there are penalty points too. 


python c4.py 


excecutes the program. 



The main strategy we have used for the ai to make strategic decisions is minimax algorithm. Minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory especially in AI game. 
It provides optimal moves for the player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. 

Considering two opponents: max and min playing. We have also used alpha-beta pruning. Alphaâ€“beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games. 

A good scoring mechanism and minimax algorithm makes AI to make the best strategic decision to win the game.
